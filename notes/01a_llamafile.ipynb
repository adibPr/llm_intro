The Germans believed that their strategy of massive bombing attacks on cities, along with the threat of German military might, would weaken their enemies and result in a humiliating defeat. In response, France invaded Germany in 1940. However, the French were outnumbered by many times and had to rely heavily on air power to overcome the enemy's defensive tactics. The Allied Powers responded with massive bombing campaigns that devastated German infrastructure, causing significant damage to the war effort.\n"
